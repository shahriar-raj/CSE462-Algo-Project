# CSE462 Algorithm Engineering Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the project work for the CSE462 Algorithm Engineering course, focused on solving the **Steiner Tree Problem**, a key challenge in network design and combinatorial optimization.

The project implements two algorithms:

1. **Dreyfus-Wagner Algorithm**: A dynamic programming approach for exact solutions.
2. **Approximation Algorithm**: A heuristic for near-optimal solutions with reduced computational cost.

## Repository Structure

- **`dreyfus-wagner/`**: Code for the Dreyfus-Wagner algorithm.
- **`minpath/`**: Code for the Approximation algorithm.
- **`testcases/`**: Test cases for evaluating the algorithms.
- **`ground_truth/`**: Ground truth results for the test cases.
- **`Approximate_Min_Path.xlsx`**: Summarized results of the Approximation algorithm.
- **`Final Steiner Tree Presentation.pdf`**: A detailed presentation on the project.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
